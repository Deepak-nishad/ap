            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
            keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
            the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
